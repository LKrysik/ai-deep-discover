# Deep Verify

## What is this?

**Deep Verify** is a structured verification workflow. It helps you find real problems in agent-produced work (code, documents, plans) before they cause issues.

**Why use it?**
- Agents tend to confirm their own work is good (bias)
- Agents skip hard verification to finish faster (shortcuts)
- Deep Verify forces thorough, honest verification

**How it works:**
1. You provide TASK (what was requested) and CONTENT (what was produced)
2. Agent identifies CONCERNS (areas that need verification)
3. Agent selects METHODS (thinking patterns) to verify each concern
4. Agent executes verification and reports FINDINGS (problems/gaps)
5. You decide what to fix, investigate deeper, or accept

**Document type:** This is a **procedural workflow** (step-by-step instructions), not reference documentation. Sections are ordered for execution, not lookup. Key Concepts provides the single source for definitions.
